I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.

I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "source": "reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning", "date": "2025-10-25T12:55:19+00:00", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ofqu5m/yorkshire_marathon_debut/", "mentioned_brands": ["Adidas"], "authority": 4, "reach": 10, "likes": 1, "comments": 0}, {"text": "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.

Television ratings ruled even if gambling was a part of the under belly, it didnt change the fact that due to the NBA's desire for the highest tv rating, you were going to get their biggest star in action every night. Especially nationally Televisied games. Example, if Michael Jordan was on the court, you were going to see Michael in full effect, and his job was launch  90 shots if he had to, because that's what people came to see. Nowadays, it's obvious you're watching a parlay, over/under, draftkings circus, and tv ratings/viewer experience has no priority. We now have NBA finals where the stars on the court will be pushed to the back burner of the show, and force viewers to watch teams pull guys you haven't seen all season off the very end of the bench, put them in the game, and run the game through them in order to appease and protect gambling sponsor's bottomline.

I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.

Television ratings ruled even if gambling was a part of the under belly, it didnt change the fact that due to the NBA's desire for the highest tv rating, you were going to get their biggest star in action every night.

I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "source": "reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning", "date": "2025-10-25T12:55:19+00:00", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ofqu5m/yorkshire_marathon_debut/", "mentioned_brands": ["Adidas"], "authority": 4, "reach": 30, "likes": 3, "comments": 0}, {"text": "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.

The print quality is good, and it fits snugly.\n\n\n\nAdidas jacket and pant set: This has a clean tracksuit look. The material is smooth, and the zippers work well. The pants taper nicely without being too tight.\n\n\n\nPlace pant: The fabric is midweight, and the fit is relaxed, giving it a nice streetwear vibe.\n\n\n\nChrome hat: The embroidery quality is solid, and the adjustable strap feels sturdy.
