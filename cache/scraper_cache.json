Some of you may remember a few months back I posted a few pictures here of the French Gendarmerie. Now I decided to formally put that into text with the Zone de d\u00e9fense de Paris.\n\nLink to previous articles:\n\n* [French 9e division d'infanterie de marine](https://www.reddit.com/r/warno/comments/1oe1uxd/hypothetical_preview_french_9e_division/)\n\n# Zone de D\u00e9fense de Paris\n\n[1er region militaire\\/Zone de d\u00e9fense de Paris \\(I think this is the insignia\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xgpodghw44xf1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7e8e3fd01698e2dcd0a80e4564299bc5269b61)\n\nFrance's internal defence forces in 1989 were divided into six geographical military regions, which in wartime would form into defence zones. One of these was the 1er r\u00e9gion militaire/Zone de d\u00e9fense de \u00ab Paris \u00bb. As the name implies, this covered the city of Paris, as well as the rest of the \u00cele-de-France region and the Centre-Val de Loire region. While the main part of the French army was a regular force, relying on a mix of active volunteers and conscripts, these military regions were almost entirely made up of reserve units. We can see this already in the 152e division d'infanterie, which was essentially a special version of these defence forces. They were also extremely light, with no tanks whatsoever (all of those were used by the armoured divisions) and not much in the way of AFVs in general.\n\nThe organization of these military regions is a bit odd. Originally they were divided into territorial divisions, but these were disbanded in 1984 and partially replaced with the brigades de zone. Most of the regions, however, only had one such brigade. There were also a number of smaller defence districts. Some line units were also subordinated directly to the region/zone command.\n\nThe Paris defence zone then was composed of the following units:\n\n* Groupement des moyens r\u00e9gionaux n\u00b0 1\n* 505e groupe d'artillerie antia\u00e9rienne l\u00e9g\u00e8re\n* 1er groupe d\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res l\u00e9gers\n* 101e r\u00e9giment du train de zone de d\u00e9fense\n* 1er r\u00e9giment de transmissions de zone de d\u00e9fense\n* 49e r\u00e9giment de transmissions\n* 5e r\u00e9giment du g\u00e9nie\n* 6e r\u00e9giment de chasseurs\n* 12e r\u00e9giment de Dragons\n* 29e r\u00e9giment de Dragons\n* 54e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de marine\n* 24e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 76e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 90e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 95e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 102e brigade de zone\n   * 102e r\u00e9giment de commandement et de soutien\n   * 152e compagnie du g\u00e9nie\n   * 162e compagnie du g\u00e9nie\n   * 70e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de marine\n   * 93e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n   * 8e r\u00e9giment de chasseurs\n\nOf the line units here, only the 24e RI was partially active, with two of its four infantry companies being active in peacetime. The rest were all reserve units. In addition, the units here were structured somewhat differently from those of the regular army. 24e RI, along with 76e RI and 95e RI, all had a squadron of AMLs. Meanwhile, most of the cavalry units here were actually static infantry regiments tasked with guarding specific sites. So yeah, more reservist slop. But don't stop reading just yet because...\n\nIn addition to the standard army forces, the region was also home to various other forces, namely:\n\n* The local detachments of the Gendarmerie mobile.\n* The Groupement blind\u00e9 de gendarmerie mobile (GBGM) or Armoured Group of the Mobile Gendarmerie, based in Satory.\n* The Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale (GIGN), also based in Satory.\n* The Garde r\u00e9publicaine or Republican Guard, in Paris itself.\n* Various squadrons of the Commandos de l'air and Gendarmerie de l'air guarding a number of airbases.\n* A company of the Fusiliers marins guarding the submarine communications center at Rosnay.\n* Stay behind forces organized by service Action, or Action Service.\n\nThe air force's CPA 10 special forces commandos and the 11e r\u00e9giment parachutiste de choc were also based here but I imagine they're probably operating somewhere else in the event of WW3. There's also the civilian national police, which I'm ignoring here.\n\nThe Gendarmerie mobile, Commandos de l'air, and Gendarmerie de l'air are all already in the game so they don't need further elaboration.\n\nThe GBGM, GIGN, and Garde r\u00e9publicaine (plus Gendarmerie mobile and Gendarmerie de l'air) are all parts of the National Gendarmerie, the national military police, which is also where the MPs come from. The GBGM was an armoured cavalry formation, composed of eight squadrons of armoured cars and infantry. Its role was a mix of internal security (which the unit continues to perform today) and fighting against Soviet infiltrators in the event of war. In the early 80s they also had a short-lived mortar squadron. The GIGN probably don't need any elaboration either, but it's worth noting at the time there was also a parachute squadron known as the EPIGN. The Garde r\u00e9publicaine, meanwhile are basically the French praetorian unit, tasked with protecting the various organs of the French government in Paris, including the president, while also holding a ceremonial role with their flashy black and blue uniforms. They have two infantry regiments and a horse cavalry regiment. The latter is mostly known for its appearance in the July 14th parades, but is an operational patrol unit too.\n\nAs noted in my last writeup, the Fusiliers marins are the French navy's security forces, whereas the actual French marines belonged to the army. Their role therefore is similar to that of the air force's Commandos de l'air. Most of their time was spent guarding the French navy's various port facilities, but Rosnay was the home to a large VLF antenna array the navy used to communicate with its submerged submarine fleet. In 1991 the navy also purchased a second site near Paris itself, but this wasn't opened until the end of the 90s.\n\nService Action is the French intelligence agency's (DGSE) direct action black ops division, probably best known for its botched bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. In addition to its foreign operations though, it also ran the country's stay-behind networks, especially after de Gaulle purged the previous networks following the Algeria coup in 1961.\n\nSo a very diverse set of formations here, but all very light.\n\nLog:\n\n* The usual **VAB PC**, **P4 PC**, **M201 PC**, and **Alouette II** (for some reason this thing isn't named PC like everything else).\n* Supply comes in the existing standard trucks plus the **Berliet GBC 8KT** 4-ton truck (smaller version of the one in 6e). Heavy army aviation would not be available, but air force Super Pumas might be used, though none were based in the region.\n\nInf:\n\n* The basic infantry are your regular **Grenadier-Voltigeurs** with the base, FR-F1, APILAS, and command variants, plus the **Groupe Antichar**, all riding the basic **VAB** (including the Milan variant for the tank hunters). For the sake of similicity I'm going to ignore the fact that half of 24e was reservist, since their setup was a bit different from both the regular army and the typical reservists. This tab is already complicated and crowded enough.\n* **Marsouins**, but only the base and command versions (no APILAS) and locked to 0 vet, riding trucks.\n* A lot of **Reservistes** coming in the basic, LRAC, FR-F1, and command variants, riding trucks. Like a lot. Good luck.\n* A new **Res. Groupe Antichar**, basically the same as the regular version but with LRAC F1s instead of APILAS (normal reservists only have LRAC 73s).\n* **Gardes** (I made this name up, but I think it should be close enough), possibly a smaller (say 5 men) squad with just the MAS-49 and MAT-49 and AA-52, plus Reservist and Security. These represent the static infantry divisions, who were tasked with guarding critical assets.\n* **Reservistes Sapeurs**.\n* **Prevote** in the **P4 Gendarmerie** as usual, plus the **Gendarmes de l'Air** in the Renault **Trafic Gendarmerie** van, and the **Gendarmes Mobiles** in the **VBRG**, plus command.\n* The GBGM also gives us the **Gren.-Volt. Gendarm.** riding the **AMX-13 VCI Gendarm.** (with the .50 cal) plus a command version. I'm not 100% sure how these were organized, but the impression I have is this is just regular infantry, so basically a Chasseurs squad. Both would have the MP trait, so that's fun.\n* **Garde Republicaine**, coming with MP, Security, and Resolute, since they're part of the Gendarmerie and being the praetorian unit. They have an actual combat dress but most likely you'd see them with a helmet and chest rig over their ceremonial uniforms. They'd probably get machine guns, but no rockets, and ride some sort of police van.\n* The famous **GIGN** with MP5s, an FR-F2, and maybe satchels, plus the Shock, MP, and SF traits. They'd ride a choice of the **Citroen CX 25 TGI** station wagon (thanks to MtW), the VBRG, or the **Ecureuil Gendarm.** helo, all with MP.\n* **Commandos de l'Air** as in 152e, again riding the **VIB**.\n* **Fusiliers Marins** with Security and Resolute, as they're part of the navy. They still used MAS-49s and had LRACs, but probably only the 73s. Like similar units, you'd probably get a smaller patrol in a jeep (like a P4) and a larger one in a truck.\n* Regular and reserve versions of the AANF1, and M2 weapons teams, plus regular Milan 2s and reservist M40A1s.\n* Another odder possibility is the Paris fire brigade, who were part of the military and had *some* military training.\n\n[GIGN](https://preview.redd.it/t7fq5uu954xf1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729c6db011f162dc66e7cb83e0b3e61ba666552b)\n\nTank:\n\n* There were no actual tanks here. Instead you'd get a mix of **AML-90**, **Res. AML-90** with Reservist, and **AML-90 Gendarm.** with MP, plus command versions of each.\n* In addition, you'd also get the **VBC-90** with MP plus a command version. The GBGM had two squadrons of them. They're essentially equivalent to the ERC-90, with the same turret and gun, but based on a VAB chassis.\n* The **P4 Milan**.\n* Paris was the former home of ERGMAu La Maltourn\u00e9e which was the workshop that handled M201 conversions, so we might also see the **M201 Milan** and, if we want to get fancy, the older **M201 ENTAC** (all of these had been converted by this point in reality though).\n\n[VBC-90](https://preview.redd.it/enh7k1ub54xf1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf209160838daad2b4819e9e8ad8b33e0125c6b1)\n\nArty:\n\n* No actual guns were present, unless you pulled some off of line units somewhere. Instead you have the **MO-81-61-C 81mm**, **VAB PM-81**, **MO-120-RT61**, **Res. MO-81-61-C 81mm**, and **Res. MO-120-RT61** mortars only.\n* As part of MtW though, we can also see the return of the Gendarmerie mortar squadron, giving us the **Gendarm. MO-81-61-C 81mm** as well, with MP. It's a bit silly but why not.\n\nRecon:\n\n* The typical **Eclaireurs** and **Reserv. Eclaireurs**, as you'd expect.\n* The **AML-60 Gendarm.**, **AML-60-12**, and **AML-90**, plus **VBC-90 Reco**.\n* **M201 106SR** and probably **M201 Rasura**.\n* **Alouette II** and **Ecureuil Gendarm.** (again with MP), or the regular **Ecureuil** for helicopter recon.\n* The 65e escadre de transport provides us with the **MS.760 Paris** and **MH.1521M Broussard** liaison aircraft.\n* **EPIGN**, the GIGN's airborne reconnaissance and support cousin. Similar to their GIGN cousins, they'd have MP5s, plus the Airborne, Shock, SF, and MP traits.\n* **Stay-Behind** (I think? I have literally no idea what they were called, the French wiki page is just called Stay-Behind), the French stay behind forces. Similar to SDRA 8, they'd have SF, Shock, Airborne, and False Flag traits. They'd probably have MAT-49s, MAS-49s, satchels, and some sort of hunting rifle (FR-F1, MAS-36, or some civilian weapon probably).\n* Motorcycles were also used, if that ever becomes a thing.\n\nAA:\n\n* Similar to a cross between 152e and Rhin. **M55 Maxson**, **HTM16**, **M36/55 40mm**, **Crotale**.\n* The regular old **53T2 20mm** and **TRM-2000 Tarasque**, plus the commando **Cerbere 76T2 20mm CPA**.\n\nHeli:\n\n* Your only real option here is maybe one card of **Alouette II AS.11**, so far from ideal.\n\nAir:\n\n* Air cover over northern France was provided by the 2e escadre de chasse with **Mirage 2000 RDI** and the 30e escadre de chasse with **Mirage F1C**, giving strong AA and maybe the LGB too.\n* There were no ground-pounding units in the region itself, but **Jaguar** from 7e escadre de chasse in nearby Saint-Dizier can provide all your ground-pounding needs.\n* Saint-Dizier was also home to a squadron of Mirage IVs until 1986, plus another squadron in Avord, if you want to nuke Paris...\n\nSo a bit of a strange one here. Sort of like French DivMob, but lacking actual tanks or artillery. Very infantry and reservist heavy, but with lots of MPs to back them up.\n\n# Sources\n\n* [http://armee-francaise-1989.wifeo.com/](http://armee-francaise-1989.wifeo.com/)\n* [http://cavaliers.blindes.free.fr/planregiment.html](http://cavaliers.blindes.free.fr/planregiment.html)\n* [https://www.force-publique.net/](https://www.force-publique.net/)\n* [https://www.flyhighaeromedia.com/the-gendarmerie-air-foces-a-strong-air-force-with-a-great-future-perspective/](https://www.flyhighaeromedia.com/the-gendarmerie-air-foces-a-strong-air-force-with-a-great-future-perspective/)\n* [https://www.escadrilles.org/histoire-armee-de-l-air/](https://www.escadrilles.org/histoire-armee-de-l-air/)\n* [https://www.gign-historique.com/](https://www.gign-historique.com/)\n* [http://www.m201.com/index.html#Hotchkiss](http://www.m201.com/index.html#Hotchkiss)", "Iron purchase for mid handicap Soo, basically I'm in the middle of changing my swing to be more well-rounded and consistently at around 20-30 level (according to the pro). Currently I have Nike Vapor Pro Combo Irons, with a stiff/super heavy shaft (also mainly what pro said, he was surprised by the weight) and recommended easier clubs for me.\n\nYesterday I got to test takomos at the sim, and this confirmed many fears; even though I'm in the middle of changing the swing and super uncomfortable, I immediately gained 20 yards with the 7 iron. I only tested the 101T with a regular lite shaft so far, because I was there with my partner and focused on enjoying the round. I want to go back there and give the 201s a try as well.\n\nI'm looking at replacing my irons now, because I fear the Vapor Pro Combos will do me more harm than good until I get there. I definitely plan on picking them up again down the line, and improving my game to the point where I can use such irons. I've loved playing them even though they wrecked my learning process.\n\n\nSome questions are on my mind, specifically because I tend to buy second hand clubs:\n- Takomos go for around 250-350 used, but I could see myself buying them new to get the peace of mind.\n- If I can see myself getting new takomos for $600 I could also see myself getting used P790s within the same price range.\n\nHow much of a difference does it make to a mid handicap player, or more specifically, someone who shoots mid-handicap and is trying to get his swing there, too?\n\nI can imagine that once I get more of a \"feel\", one step that I would start to notice 1-3 years is the difference between takomo 101T and higher-quality irons like the P790, much earlier than I'd benefit from a jump to something in the less forgiving P770 (or Nike Pro Combo) range. \n\nThis leads me to believe it's wise to go for a brand right away, because used vs. new shouldn't impact me as much yet at my level. I'm wondering if this thought process makes any sense, or if you have and valuable input to how club-progression can be handled efficiently?\n\nThanks in advance:)", "The Grateful Ducks https://preview.redd.it/m75ovvohh9xf1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34704b46366117ea64f7b7030c24df2a219479ea\n\nI've always heard how Oregon has the best uniforms.

Dressed in an electrifying crimson red, the sneaker is crafted from premium leather with tonal stitching, creating a striking, monochrome statement piece.\n\nSignature Off White hallmarks are present throughout: exposed foam on the tongue, industrial style Helvetica text along the medial side, and the instantly recognizable zip-tie tag in a contrasting hue. Translucent and layered details add depth, while the slightly exaggerated Swoosh nods to Abloh\u2019s experimental design language.\n\nSet atop the classic Air Force 1 sole with Nike Air cushioning, the sneaker balances avant garde design with all day wearability. Finished with subtle co branding on the heel and sole, the \u2018Crimson\u2019 edition captures the perfect collision of streetwear innovation and heritage sportswear.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f **My Opinion**:\n\nHow do we feel about the unreleased collab?

Dressed in an electrifying crimson red, the sneaker is crafted from premium leather with tonal stitching, creating a striking, monochrome statement piece.\n\nSignature Off White hallmarks are present throughout: exposed foam on the tongue, industrial style Helvetica text along the medial side, and the instantly recognizable zip-tie tag in a contrasting hue. Translucent and layered details add depth, while the slightly exaggerated Swoosh nods to Abloh\u2019s experimental design language.\n\nSet atop the classic Air Force 1 sole with Nike Air cushioning, the sneaker balances avant garde design with all day wearability. Finished with subtle co branding on the heel and sole, the \u2018Crimson\u2019 edition captures the perfect collision of streetwear innovation and heritage sportswear.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f **My Opinion**:\n\nHow do we feel about the unreleased collab?

Some of you may remember a few months back I posted a few pictures here of the French Gendarmerie. Now I decided to formally put that into text with the Zone de d\u00e9fense de Paris.\n\nLink to previous articles:\n\n* [French 9e division d'infanterie de marine](https://www.reddit.com/r/warno/comments/1oe1uxd/hypothetical_preview_french_9e_division/)\n\n# Zone de D\u00e9fense de Paris\n\n[1er region militaire\\/Zone de d\u00e9fense de Paris \\(I think this is the insignia\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xgpodghw44xf1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7e8e3fd01698e2dcd0a80e4564299bc5269b61)\n\nFrance's internal defence forces in 1989 were divided into six geographical military regions, which in wartime would form into defence zones. One of these was the 1er r\u00e9gion militaire/Zone de d\u00e9fense de \u00ab Paris \u00bb. As the name implies, this covered the city of Paris, as well as the rest of the \u00cele-de-France region and the Centre-Val de Loire region. While the main part of the French army was a regular force, relying on a mix of active volunteers and conscripts, these military regions were almost entirely made up of reserve units. We can see this already in the 152e division d'infanterie, which was essentially a special version of these defence forces. They were also extremely light, with no tanks whatsoever (all of those were used by the armoured divisions) and not much in the way of AFVs in general.\n\nThe organization of these military regions is a bit odd. Originally they were divided into territorial divisions, but these were disbanded in 1984 and partially replaced with the brigades de zone. Most of the regions, however, only had one such brigade. There were also a number of smaller defence districts. Some line units were also subordinated directly to the region/zone command.\n\nThe Paris defence zone then was composed of the following units:\n\n* Groupement des moyens r\u00e9gionaux n\u00b0 1\n* 505e groupe d'artillerie antia\u00e9rienne l\u00e9g\u00e8re\n* 1er groupe d\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res l\u00e9gers\n* 101e r\u00e9giment du train de zone de d\u00e9fense\n* 1er r\u00e9giment de transmissions de zone de d\u00e9fense\n* 49e r\u00e9giment de transmissions\n* 5e r\u00e9giment du g\u00e9nie\n* 6e r\u00e9giment de chasseurs\n* 12e r\u00e9giment de Dragons\n* 29e r\u00e9giment de Dragons\n* 54e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de marine\n* 24e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 76e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 90e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 95e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n* 102e brigade de zone\n   * 102e r\u00e9giment de commandement et de soutien\n   * 152e compagnie du g\u00e9nie\n   * 162e compagnie du g\u00e9nie\n   * 70e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de marine\n   * 93e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie\n   * 8e r\u00e9giment de chasseurs\n\nOf the line units here, only the 24e RI was partially active, with two of its four infantry companies being active in peacetime. The rest were all reserve units. In addition, the units here were structured somewhat differently from those of the regular army. 24e RI, along with 76e RI and 95e RI, all had a squadron of AMLs. Meanwhile, most of the cavalry units here were actually static infantry regiments tasked with guarding specific sites. So yeah, more reservist slop. But don't stop reading just yet because...\n\nIn addition to the standard army forces, the region was also home to various other forces, namely:\n\n* The local detachments of the Gendarmerie mobile.\n* The Groupement blind\u00e9 de gendarmerie mobile (GBGM) or Armoured Group of the Mobile Gendarmerie, based in Satory.\n* The Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale (GIGN), also based in Satory.\n* The Garde r\u00e9publicaine or Republican Guard, in Paris itself.\n* Various squadrons of the Commandos de l'air and Gendarmerie de l'air guarding a number of airbases.\n* A company of the Fusiliers marins guarding the submarine communications center at Rosnay.\n* Stay behind forces organized by service Action, or Action Service.\n\nThe air force's CPA 10 special forces commandos and the 11e r\u00e9giment parachutiste de choc were also based here but I imagine they're probably operating somewhere else in the event of WW3. There's also the civilian national police, which I'm ignoring here.\n\nThe Gendarmerie mobile, Commandos de l'air, and Gendarmerie de l'air are all already in the game so they don't need further elaboration.\n\nThe GBGM, GIGN, and Garde r\u00e9publicaine (plus Gendarmerie mobile and Gendarmerie de l'air) are all parts of the National Gendarmerie, the national military police, which is also where the MPs come from. The GBGM was an armoured cavalry formation, composed of eight squadrons of armoured cars and infantry. Its role was a mix of internal security (which the unit continues to perform today) and fighting against Soviet infiltrators in the event of war. In the early 80s they also had a short-lived mortar squadron. The GIGN probably don't need any elaboration either, but it's worth noting at the time there was also a parachute squadron known as the EPIGN. The Garde r\u00e9publicaine, meanwhile are basically the French praetorian unit, tasked with protecting the various organs of the French government in Paris, including the president, while also holding a ceremonial role with their flashy black and blue uniforms. They have two infantry regiments and a horse cavalry regiment. The latter is mostly known for its appearance in the July 14th parades, but is an operational patrol unit too.\n\nAs noted in my last writeup, the Fusiliers marins are the French navy's security forces, whereas the actual French marines belonged to the army. Their role therefore is similar to that of the air force's Commandos de l'air. Most of their time was spent guarding the French navy's various port facilities, but Rosnay was the home to a large VLF antenna array the navy used to communicate with its submerged submarine fleet. In 1991 the navy also purchased a second site near Paris itself, but this wasn't opened until the end of the 90s.\n\nService Action is the French intelligence agency's (DGSE) direct action black ops division, probably best known for its botched bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. In addition to its foreign operations though, it also ran the country's stay-behind networks, especially after de Gaulle purged the previous networks following the Algeria coup in 1961.\n\nSo a very diverse set of formations here, but all very light.\n\nLog:\n\n* The usual **VAB PC**, **P4 PC**, **M201 PC**, and **Alouette II** (for some reason this thing isn't named PC like everything else).\n* Supply comes in the existing standard trucks plus the **Berliet GBC 8KT** 4-ton truck (smaller version of the one in 6e). Heavy army aviation would not be available, but air force Super Pumas might be used, though none were based in the region.\n\nInf:\n\n* The basic infantry are your regular **Grenadier-Voltigeurs** with the base, FR-F1, APILAS, and command variants, plus the **Groupe Antichar**, all riding the basic **VAB** (including the Milan variant for the tank hunters). For the sake of similicity I'm going to ignore the fact that half of 24e was reservist, since their setup was a bit different from both the regular army and the typical reservists. This tab is already complicated and crowded enough.\n* **Marsouins**, but only the base and command versions (no APILAS) and locked to 0 vet, riding trucks.\n* A lot of **Reservistes** coming in the basic, LRAC, FR-F1, and command variants, riding trucks. Like a lot. Good luck.\n* A new **Res. Groupe Antichar**, basically the same as the regular version but with LRAC F1s instead of APILAS (normal reservists only have LRAC 73s).\n* **Gardes** (I made this name up, but I think it should be close enough), possibly a smaller (say 5 men) squad with just the MAS-49 and MAT-49 and AA-52, plus Reservist and Security. These represent the static infantry divisions, who were tasked with guarding critical assets.\n* **Reservistes Sapeurs**.\n* **Prevote** in the **P4 Gendarmerie** as usual, plus the **Gendarmes de l'Air** in the Renault **Trafic Gendarmerie** van, and the **Gendarmes Mobiles** in the **VBRG**, plus command.\n* The GBGM also gives us the **Gren.-Volt. Gendarm.** riding the **AMX-13 VCI Gendarm.** (with the .50 cal) plus a command version. I'm not 100% sure how these were organized, but the impression I have is this is just regular infantry, so basically a Chasseurs squad. Both would have the MP trait, so that's fun.\n* **Garde Republicaine**, coming with MP, Security, and Resolute, since they're part of the Gendarmerie and being the praetorian unit. They have an actual combat dress but most likely you'd see them with a helmet and chest rig over their ceremonial uniforms. They'd probably get machine guns, but no rockets, and ride some sort of police van.\n* The famous **GIGN** with MP5s, an FR-F2, and maybe satchels, plus the Shock, MP, and SF traits. They'd ride a choice of the **Citroen CX 25 TGI** station wagon (thanks to MtW), the VBRG, or the **Ecureuil Gendarm.** helo, all with MP.\n* **Commandos de l'Air** as in 152e, again riding the **VIB**.\n* **Fusiliers Marins** with Security and Resolute, as they're part of the navy. They still used MAS-49s and had LRACs, but probably only the 73s. Like similar units, you'd probably get a smaller patrol in a jeep (like a P4) and a larger one in a truck.\n* Regular and reserve versions of the AANF1, and M2 weapons teams, plus regular Milan 2s and reservist M40A1s.\n* Another odder possibility is the Paris fire brigade, who were part of the military and had *some* military training.\n\n[GIGN](https://preview.redd.it/t7fq5uu954xf1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729c6db011f162dc66e7cb83e0b3e61ba666552b)\n\nTank:\n\n* There were no actual tanks here. Instead you'd get a mix of **AML-90**, **Res. AML-90** with Reservist, and **AML-90 Gendarm.** with MP, plus command versions of each.\n* In addition, you'd also get the **VBC-90** with MP plus a command version. The GBGM had two squadrons of them. They're essentially equivalent to the ERC-90, with the same turret and gun, but based on a VAB chassis.\n* The **P4 Milan**.\n* Paris was the former home of ERGMAu La Maltourn\u00e9e which was the workshop that handled M201 conversions, so we might also see the **M201 Milan** and, if we want to get fancy, the older **M201 ENTAC** (all of these had been converted by this point in reality though).\n\n[VBC-90](https://preview.redd.it/enh7k1ub54xf1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf209160838daad2b4819e9e8ad8b33e0125c6b1)\n\nArty:\n\n* No actual guns were present, unless you pulled some off of line units somewhere. Instead you have the **MO-81-61-C 81mm**, **VAB PM-81**, **MO-120-RT61**, **Res. MO-81-61-C 81mm**, and **Res. MO-120-RT61** mortars only.\n* As part of MtW though, we can also see the return of the Gendarmerie mortar squadron, giving us the **Gendarm. MO-81-61-C 81mm** as well, with MP. It's a bit silly but why not.\n\nRecon:\n\n* The typical **Eclaireurs** and **Reserv. Eclaireurs**, as you'd expect.\n* The **AML-60 Gendarm.**, **AML-60-12**, and **AML-90**, plus **VBC-90 Reco**.\n* **M201 106SR** and probably **M201 Rasura**.\n* **Alouette II** and **Ecureuil Gendarm.** (again with MP), or the regular **Ecureuil** for helicopter recon.\n* The 65e escadre de transport provides us with the **MS.760 Paris** and **MH.1521M Broussard** liaison aircraft.\n* **EPIGN**, the GIGN's airborne reconnaissance and support cousin. Similar to their GIGN cousins, they'd have MP5s, plus the Airborne, Shock, SF, and MP traits.\n* **Stay-Behind** (I think? I have literally no idea what they were called, the French wiki page is just called Stay-Behind), the French stay behind forces. Similar to SDRA 8, they'd have SF, Shock, Airborne, and False Flag traits. They'd probably have MAT-49s, MAS-49s, satchels, and some sort of hunting rifle (FR-F1, MAS-36, or some civilian weapon probably).\n* Motorcycles were also used, if that ever becomes a thing.\n\nAA:\n\n* Similar to a cross between 152e and Rhin. **M55 Maxson**, **HTM16**, **M36/55 40mm**, **Crotale**.\n* The regular old **53T2 20mm** and **TRM-2000 Tarasque**, plus the commando **Cerbere 76T2 20mm CPA**.\n\nHeli:\n\n* Your only real option here is maybe one card of **Alouette II AS.11**, so far from ideal.\n\nAir:\n\n* Air cover over northern France was provided by the 2e escadre de chasse with **Mirage 2000 RDI** and the 30e escadre de chasse with **Mirage F1C**, giving strong AA and maybe the LGB too.\n* There were no ground-pounding units in the region itself, but **Jaguar** from 7e escadre de chasse in nearby Saint-Dizier can provide all your ground-pounding needs.\n* Saint-Dizier was also home to a squadron of Mirage IVs until 1986, plus another squadron in Avord, if you want to nuke Paris...\n\nSo a bit of a strange one here. Sort of like French DivMob, but lacking actual tanks or artillery. Very infantry and reservist heavy, but with lots of MPs to back them up.\n\n# Sources\n\n* [http://armee-francaise-1989.wifeo.com/](http://armee-francaise-1989.wifeo.com/)\n* [http://cavaliers.blindes.free.fr/planregiment.html](http://cavaliers.blindes.free.fr/planregiment.html)\n* [https://www.force-publique.net/](https://www.force-publique.net/)\n* [https://www.flyhighaeromedia.com/the-gendarmerie-air-foces-a-strong-air-force-with-a-great-future-perspective/](https://www.flyhighaeromedia.com/the-gendarmerie-air-foces-a-strong-air-force-with-a-great-future-perspective/)\n* [https://www.escadrilles.org/histoire-armee-de-l-air/](https://www.escadrilles.org/histoire-armee-de-l-air/)\n* [https://www.gign-historique.com/](https://www.gign-historique.com/)\n* [http://www.m201.com/index.html#Hotchkiss](http://www.m201.com/index.html#Hotchkiss)", "source": "reddit.com/r/warno", "date": "2025-10-25T13:49:00+00:00", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/warno/comments/1ofs0dd/hypothetical_preview_french_zone_de_d\u00e9fense_de/", "mentioned_brands": ["Puma"], "authority": 4, "reach": 10, "likes": 1, "comments": 0}, {"text": "Iron purchase for mid handicap Soo, basically I'm in the middle of changing my swing to be more well-rounded and consistently at around 20-30 level (according to the pro). Currently I have Nike Vapor Pro Combo Irons, with a stiff/super heavy shaft (also mainly what pro said, he was surprised by the weight) and recommended easier clubs for me.\n\nYesterday I got to test takomos at the sim, and this confirmed many fears; even though I'm in the middle of changing the swing and super uncomfortable, I immediately gained 20 yards with the 7 iron. I only tested the 101T with a regular lite shaft so far, because I was there with my partner and focused on enjoying the round. I want to go back there and give the 201s a try as well.\n\nI'm looking at replacing my irons now, because I fear the Vapor Pro Combos will do me more harm than good until I get there. I definitely plan on picking them up again down the line, and improving my game to the point where I can use such irons. I've loved playing them even though they wrecked my learning process.\n\n\nSome questions are on my mind, specifically because I tend to buy second hand clubs:\n- Takomos go for around 250-350 used, but I could see myself buying them new to get the peace of mind.\n- If I can see myself getting new takomos for $600 I could also see myself getting used P790s within the same price range.\n\nHow much of a difference does it make to a mid handicap player, or more specifically, someone who shoots mid-handicap and is trying to get his swing there, too?\n\nI can imagine that once I get more of a \"feel\", one step that I would start to notice 1-3 years is the difference between takomo 101T and higher-quality irons like the P790, much earlier than I'd benefit from a jump to something in the less forgiving P770 (or Nike Pro Combo) range. \n\nThis leads me to believe it's wise to go for a brand right away, because used vs. new shouldn't impact me as much yet at my level. I'm wondering if this thought process makes any sense, or if you have and valuable input to how club-progression can be handled efficiently?\n\nThanks in advance:)", "source": "reddit.com/r/golf", "date": "2025-10-25T13:44:49+00:00", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1ofrx1g/iron_purchase_for_mid_handicap/", "mentioned_brands": ["Nike"], "authority": 4, "reach": 20, "likes": 2, "comments": 0}, {"text": "The Grateful Ducks https://preview.redd.it/m75ovvohh9xf1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34704b46366117ea64f7b7030c24df2a219479ea\n\nI've always heard how Oregon has the best uniforms.

We now have NBA finals where the stars on the court will be pushed to the back burner of the show, and force viewers to watch teams pull guys you haven't seen all season off the very end of the bench, put them in the game, and run the game through them in order to appease and protect gambling sponsor's bottomline.  [Shannon Jr. WFC finals running the show over &lt;35% owned capitan spot on draft kings Anthony Edwards.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r0sez8GA8Co&amp;pp=ygUxV2VzdGVybiBjb25mZXJlbmNlIGZpbmFscyBzaGFubm9uIGpyIHRpbWJlcndvbHZlcw%3D%3D)\nYou never saw this back in the day.  Keith Booth, Randy Brown, Jud Buelcher, or Scott Burell could never on a 1997 Chicago Bulls Michael Jordan internationally televised game. The so-called \"face of the league\" is sitting out and dropping dimes to bettors for a piece of the pie.. LeBron is no MJ smh.

I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.

Television ratings ruled even if gambling was a part of the under belly, it didnt change the fact that due to the NBA's desire for the highest tv rating, you were going to get their biggest star in action every night. Especially nationally Televisied games. Example, if Michael Jordan was on the court, you were going to see Michael in full effect, and his job was launch  90 shots if he had to, because that's what people came to see. Nowadays, it's obvious you're watching a parlay, over/under, draftkings circus, and tv ratings/viewer experience has no priority. We now have NBA finals where the stars on the court will be pushed to the back burner of the show, and force viewers to watch teams pull guys you haven't seen all season off the very end of the bench, put them in the game, and run the game through them in order to appease and protect gambling sponsor's bottomline.

I have been running since late spring of 2024, and have since become quite fanatical about training and improving. I ran my first race in September 2024, a 40:50 10k. I since trained hard, hitting 70k a week basically every single week until running a 16:44 5k in March 25, this shocked me a bit, I realised at this point I was getting quite decent very quickly. I then entered a hilly half marathon in Early may, running a 1:22, which doesn't compare very well to my 5k pace, but was enough to delight and motivate me. I then decided to enter the Yorkshire marathon shortly after. \n\nI put my own plan in place starting 14 weeks out. I followed a strict schedule starting at my usual 70k a week, and peaking and 144k 2 weeks out, I regret not running more at the start of the build, although don't think i could have peaked any higher. Next time I will run more weeks around 120k, and less at 70-100. At the 70k pw mark i didnt have to double, although I started doubling on mondays and thursday quite soon in my build, purely to build mileage. As my easy run volume Increased, I incorporated doubles onto my tuesday, Wednesday and Friday runs too. At this point I was doubling just to reduce the strain on my body, whilst sustainably increasing mileage. I had quite a sharp 2-week taper.\n\nI raced a local 10k, (the same one as my first race a year prior) and ran 35:59 in Early september, this was a decent time, although I wanted slightly quicker. I had 1 down week before this race, and began building again straight after.\n\nMy weeks went as follows:\n\nMonday- Speed session, anything really, reps from around 400 m to 2k. I generally hit these paces pretty hard, often at or around 5k pace.\n\nTuesday- Easy\n\nWednesday- Easy\n\nThursday- Marathon-based session, loads and loads of stuff at 4:00/k, long, hilly tempos up to around 15k, reps of 3k, 5k and more. Often did progression runs etc.\n\nFriday-Easy\n\nSaturday- Long. Woke up early every Saturday to do a long run, starting (in hindsight) too low, at around 10 miles, and peaked at 22.5. I did my long runs almost exclusively at a steady pace, roughly 4:20/k. This pace felt very very comfortable every week, the longer runs at the peak of my build worked as great confidence boosters. My key long runs often progressed throughout, and my last big one two weeks out featured a long steady progressive, before 10k at MP.\n\nSunday- Easy, sometimes off.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI had what i think was a very successful carb load, I didn't track it but could tell I was eating loads of carbs whilst not going overboard. I did this in quite an unorthodox way, lots of sugary drinks, chews etc. The morning of the race was perfect weather, I had a carb drink and red bull in the hour leading up, and porridge, bread and honey around 2.5 hours before. During my warmup, my body felt great, although my HR was very high, which seems to be typical of race warmups for me, I imagine, due to the stress and pre-race adrenaline.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race has a huge downhill right at the start, and we went off quick, besides that the race was uneventful for all of the right reasons. I found a nice rhythm at my desired pace and gradually picked it up in the last 10k before kicking hard for the last 2k or so. I felt completely fine throughout and never threatened hitting the wall. I took about 90g carbs/hr and drank maybe 100ml of water at every station.\n\n\\*I did have a tiny wobble at around 10 miles, as things seemed to get slightly harder from then on,  Everyone around me seemed to be speeding up whilst I was not. I ended up finishing above nearly everyone who I had been around at that point, Im glad of course that I didnt get sucked into going with them, mid-race, this kind of mental clarity is hard to gather, however and it was enough to throw me off ever so slightly.\n\nThe race is pretty flat and the support was good the whole way round. We had the wind at our backs slightly for the last 10k which helped. My HR got quite high earlier than expected, and averaged 177, luckily this wasnt an issue, often when racing I dont deem HR a useful indication of effort at all.\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy body was a complete wreck after this one. I could barely walk until Wednesday. I didn't care at all, however, and was completely over the moon with my time. The race was very well organized and I'll do it again I'm sure. Not really sure what else to put here, feel free to ask any questions. \n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.", "source": "reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning", "date": "2025-10-25T12:55:19+00:00", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ofqu5m/yorkshire_marathon_debut/", "mentioned_brands": ["Adidas"], "authority": 4, "reach": 30, "likes": 3, "comments": 0}, {"text": "Got my latest mixed streetwears Just got a mix of pieces from my recent Weidian haul and wanted to share a quick review.\n\n\n\nChrome leather jacket: This is a solid pickup.
